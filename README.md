# description:
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed for two players. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a simple yet engaging way to play Tic-Tac-Toe online. The game features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for players to enjoy quick matches. This project is an excellent demonstration of how to create interactive web applications with basic web technologies.

# How It Works
Game Board: The board is a 3x3 grid where players can place their marks (X or O) by clicking on the cells.
Turns: Players take turns placing their marks. Player 1 uses X and Player 2 uses O.
Win/Draw Detection: After each move, the game checks for a win (three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw (all cells filled without a winner).
Game End: The game announces the result and allows players to restart the game to play again.

# Project Structure
index.html: Contains the HTML structure, including the game board and control buttons.
styles.css: Includes the CSS for styling the game, ensuring a visually appealing experience.
script.js: Houses the JavaScript code that controls the game logic and interactivity.
